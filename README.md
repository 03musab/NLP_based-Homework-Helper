# 🧠 NLP-Based Homework Helper

An intelligent, Streamlit-powered assistant that helps students solve homework questions using natural language processing and modular agent-based reasoning.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🔍 Smart Query Parsing** — Understands academic questions and extracts intent (problem type, subject, keywords).
* **🧩 Agent-Based Architecture** — Modular agents for retrieval, synthesis, and response generation.
* **🎨 Streamlit UI** — Clean, responsive interface for seamless interaction.
* **⚡ Real-Time Answers** — Fast, structured responses across subjects (math, science, history, programming, etc.).
* **🔁 Extensible** — Add or replace agents for domain-specific behavior.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/03musab/NLP_based-Homework-Helper.git
cd NLP_based-Homework-Helper
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> `requirements.txt` should include packages like `streamlit`, `spacy`, `transformers`, and any vector DB / retrieval libs you use.

### 3. Run the app locally

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 4. Deploy

* Push the repo to GitHub.
* Connect the repository to **Streamlit Cloud** and deploy using the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.

## 🧭 How it Works (High-level)

1. **User input** through the Streamlit UI.
2. **Query parser** (spaCy / custom rules) extracts intent, difficulty level, and keywords.
3. **Agent manager** routes the parsed query to appropriate agents:

   * **Retrieval agent** — fetches context / sources (optional: vector DB).
   * **Reasoning agent** — breaks the problem into steps and solves.
   * **Synthesis agent** — formats final answer: explanation, steps, and references.
4. **UI** displays the structured response and optional explanation steps.

## 📌 Use Cases

* Academic Q&A across subjects (math, physics, chemistry, history, language).
* Definitions, summaries, and concept explanations.
* Step-by-step solutions and structured learning support.

---

## 💡 Tips & Extensions

* Add a **solution-checker agent** to verify student answers.
* Integrate a **knowledge base** (local files or vector DB) for subject-specific resources.
* Add **assistant personas** (concise tutor, detailed explainer, hint-giver).
* Add unit tests for agents to ensure stable behavior.

If you'd like, I can:

* generate a sample `requirements.txt`,
* create a starter `agents.py` skeleton,
* or produce a Streamlit layout for `streamlit_app.py`.
